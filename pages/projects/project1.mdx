## üìã Project Overview

The **Weather Station** project is designed to monitor and log environmental data such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and light levels. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller connected to a range of sensors, with the data being displayed on a web dashboard.

The project serves as an educational tool, a personal weather station, or a part of a larger IoT ecosystem, providing real-time insights into the local environment.

### üîë Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of environmental data.
- **Web Dashboard**: A responsive web interface for viewing data in real-time.
- **Data Logging**: Historical data is stored and visualized over time.
- **Alert System**: Configurable alerts for extreme weather conditions.
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the dashboard.
