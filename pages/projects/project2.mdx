## 📝 Overview

The **Smart Home Automation** project aims to create a fully integrated system for managing various IoT devices within a home environment. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller as the central hub, connected to sensors, lights, and other devices via MQTT and controlled through a Node-RED dashboard.

This project enhances convenience, security, and energy efficiency by allowing users to monitor and control their home remotely.

### 🔧 Features

- **🧠 Centralized Control Hub:** An ESP32-based microcontroller acting as the brain of the system.
- **📊 Real-Time Monitoring:** Sensor data (temperature, humidity, motion) is continuously monitored.
- **🌐 Remote Access:** Control lights, appliances, and security systems from anywhere via a mobile app.
- **💡 Energy Efficiency:** Automated routines for turning off unused devices and adjusting thermostats.
- **🔄 Scalability:** Easily add more devices and sensors to the system.
